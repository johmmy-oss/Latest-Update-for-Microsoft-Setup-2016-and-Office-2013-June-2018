Microsoft Office updates are always frequent and as always they have released non-security updates and bug fixes for Office 2013 and Office 2016 on the first Tuesday of the month.
Some most important which caught our attention:
Toward the end of last year, Microsoft was gotten out leaving an unpleasantly defenseless Equation Editor in Office for a long time. Another patch restores the MT Extra textual style so conditions made with the old Equation Editor can be seen.
Another fix refreshes the interpretation of the English expression “forwarding a meeting” for different languages.
As a regular part of an update, windows will install it automatically into Office 2013 and Office 2016.
Here is the brief of new updates:
